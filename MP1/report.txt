The tasks were divided so that each member did the same amount of work.

Solutions developed:

a) Only accepts 0 and 1 as the first number.
    If it's 0 goes to a different state where any month beginning with 1 isn't reachable (Oct, Nov, Dec).
    Likewise if it reads 1 first.

b) No number can begin wit a 0, except if the number is just 0. 08 isn't valid, but 8, 10, 123, 4323.. are.
    This way, the solution was divided in 3 parts. When the input is 0, one digit and two or more digits.
    If it reads 0, writes two zeros.
    If it reads just one digit != 0, it will put a zero before.
    If there's two or more digits, and the first one is != 0, just copies.

c) This solution is similar to the one implemented in b), but extended to 4 digits.

d) Simply copies the symbol it sees.

e) Any digit or "/" that is read will not be written.

f) Ignores the day and month and only copies the year.

g) A leap year is divisible by 400 or, if divisible by 4 it isn't by 100. 
    We are only accepting years between [1901 - 2099], wich means:
        the only year that is divisible by 100 is 2000. It isn't a leap year.
        the other numbers aren't divisible by 100.
    We can check if a given number is divisible by 4 if it's last two digits are multiples of 4. ex: 732 is because 32 = 4*8
    Given a 
    So, we have three tasks:
     To check if a number is 2000, -> not leap
     If the last two digits are multiples of 4, -> leap
     Else -> not leap


h) Starts with the M and checks every possibility, then moves on to D and does the same, and so on until it reaches the end of the symbols.

i) Inverting the h)

j) Composing h) with b) and c) creates a transducer that transforms a Roman number to a two/four digit Arabic Number  
   Then concatenate them with several d) to read the "/".

k) Concatenates several d) to read all the birthdate, except the month part.
   On the month area, we concatenate with the transducer a)

l) Composing j) with k) creates a transducer that transforms Roman birthdates to Arabic-text birthdates
    Invert it and we get the solution

m) Composing j) with f) creates a transducer that transforms Roman birthdates into that year in Arabic.
    Composing the recently created with g) will tell us if the year is leap or not.
